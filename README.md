🏠 House Price Prediction App

A simple and interactive Machine Learning web app built using Streamlit and scikit-learn that predicts house prices based on features like area and number of bedrooms.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying a Linear Regression model as an interactive web application.

🚀 Features

✅ Predict house prices instantly based on user input
✅ Visualize the regression line and actual vs predicted values
✅ Built with Streamlit for an interactive web experience
✅ Uses scikit-learn for linear regression modeling

🧠 Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Streamlit (for web app)

scikit-learn (for Linear Regression model)

pandas, numpy (for data handling)

matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
